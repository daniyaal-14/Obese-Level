# Obese-Level
Here I have made a Machine Learning model which could predict Obesity Level based on various factor.

##Model Used
I have tried applying DESICION TREES MODEL using sci-kit Package and have reached 80 percentage accuracy and I am still looking into increasing the accuracy

## Decision-Tree-Classification
Decision Tree is a decision-making tool that uses a flowchart-like tree structure or is a model of decisions and all of their possible results, including outcomes, input costs and utility.  
Decision-tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning algorithms. It works for both continuous as well as categorical output variables. 

Decision tree classification observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict the class of the data.
